# SoloSphere Authentication UI

This directory contains documentation and specifications for the authentication interface components of SoloSphere.

## Components

The authentication UI consists of several key components:

1. **Login Page** - The main entry point for authenticated users
2. **Registration Page** - For new users to create an account
3. **Password Reset Flow** - For users who need to reset their password
4. **Auth Layout** - A shared layout component for all authentication pages

## Design Specifications

For detailed design specifications of the login interface, see [login-design-specification.md](./login-design-specification.md).

## Implementation Details

The authentication UI is implemented using:

- **Next.js** for the application framework
- **React** for component architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Supabase Auth** for authentication backend
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience

## Assets

The following assets are used in the authentication UI:

- Logo: `/public/logo.svg`
- Feature image: `/public/images/auth-feature.jpg`

## Workflows

### Login Flow

1. User navigates to `/auth/login`
2. User enters email and password
3. On submission, credentials are validated through Supabase Auth
4. On success, user is redirected to the dashboard
5. On failure, appropriate error messages are displayed

### Registration Flow

1. User navigates to `/auth/signup`
2. User enters required information (name, email, password)
3. On submission, account is created in Supabase Auth
4. Verification email is sent to the user
5. User confirms email and is redirected to complete profile setup

## Testing

Tests for authentication components can be found in their respective directories:

- `src/components/auth/__tests__/`
- `src/app/auth/__tests__/`

## Accessibility

All authentication UI components are built with accessibility in mind:

- All forms are keyboard navigable
- Form elements have appropriate labels and ARIA attributes
- Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Error states are clearly communicated to users

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the authentication UI:

1. Social login integration (Google, GitHub)
2. Two-factor authentication
3. Magic link authentication
4. OAuth provider support
