# UI/UX Experience

## AI Assistant Interface

### Initial Experience
- As a new user, I want a friendly onboarding tutorial that introduces me to the AI assistant capabilities so I understand how it can help me.
- As a user, I want the AI assistant to have a distinct visual identity within the SoloSphere app so I can easily recognize AI-driven components.
- As a user, I want to see examples of what the AI assistant can do during onboarding so I understand its value immediately.

### Assistant Visibility
- As a user, I want a persistent but unobtrusive AI assistant button or icon that I can access from anywhere in the application.
- As a user, I want the option to minimize or expand the AI assistant interface based on my current needs.
- As a user, I want visual cues that indicate when the AI has new suggestions or insights for me without being disruptive.

## Interaction Patterns

### Conversation Design
- As a user, I want conversations with the AI to feel natural and contextual, with the AI remembering previous interactions.
- As a user, I want to easily distinguish between my messages and the AI's responses through clear visual differentiation.

- As a user, I want to provide thumbs up/down feedback on AI suggestions to help it learn my preferences.
- As a user, I want to see how and why the AI made certain suggestions to understand its reasoning.

### Learning & Improvement
- As a user, I want to see how my feedback has improved the AI's suggestions over time so I know it's learning.
- As a user, I want occasionally prompted micro-surveys about AI performance that take less than 10 seconds to complete.
- As a user, I want a dedicated area to provide detailed feedback about the AI if I choose to do so.

## Context Awareness

### Workspace Integration

### Notification System
- As a user, I want to customize when and how the AI assistant notifies me about insights or suggestions.

### Accessibility Considerations
- As a user with visual impairments, I want the AI assistant to be fully compatible with screen readers.
- As a user with motor limitations, I want to be able to control the AI assistant using keyboard shortcuts or voice commands.
- As a user with cognitive differences, I want the option for simpler language and step-by-step guidance from the AI.

## Multi-Device Experience

### Responsive Design
- As a mobile user, I want the AI assistant interface to adapt elegantly to smaller screens without losing functionality.
- As a tablet user, I want to use touch gestures to interact with the AI assistant in intuitive ways.
- As a desktop user, I want keyboard shortcuts for efficient interaction with the AI assistant.

### Continuity
- As a user who switches between devices, I want my AI assistant conversations and settings to seamlessly sync.
- As a user, I want the AI to remember the context of what I was doing even if I switch devices mid-task.
- As a user, I want to start a task with the AI on my phone and seamlessly continue it later on my desktop.
